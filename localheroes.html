								<p><strong>THE COMPANY</strong> VOLUME is a small Copenhagen-based company that focuses on music-related projects. I interned at VOLUME during my 9th semester @ Aalborg University. I worked predominantly on their Local Heroes project, a web-based platform that lets fans vote on which local band should perform as the opening act for the headlining band. </p>
								<p><strong>MY ASSIGNMENTS</strong> in this this project were:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>To propose a redesign of the website.</li>
									<li>To make the new site scale to different devices.</li>
									<li>To introduce an element of gamification to the website, with a score system
										that attracts new users to join, and gives existing users incentive to use the
										site regularly. </li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>THE TIMEFRAME</strong> for this project was 4 months.</p>
								<p><strong>MY EXPERIENCE</strong> at the time was extremely limited. Miscommunication had effectively landed me in a role as a web developer with very little experience with HTML, CSS and Drupal - and with noone at the company to learn from. My approach to usability testing was also very flawed as I had not planned for tests pre-mockups.</p>

						<p><strong>MY ROLE</strong> in this this project was to propose a redesign for the webpage that had elements of gamification as part of the user experience. I knew a few things about usability at the time, but it wasn't my focus. Noone else worked on the project with me, so what could be achieved in the timeframe was limited. VOLUME had no in-house usability or web-development professionals to seek council from. This project is presented in 3 stages:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>THE OLD SITE:</strong> in this section, I go over some of the usability flaws of the original (and now unlisted) Local Heroes website.</li>
							<li><strong>THE NEW SITE:</strong> is where I go over my thoughts and suggestions for a complete redesign with gamification elements. I show some mockups from a desktop-size viewport.</li>
							<li><strong>EVALUATION & REFLECTION:</strong> is the last stop in which I iterate on a few take-aways and tell you how I would have tackled the project differently today.</li>
						</ol>
						<div class="numberCircle"><span>1</span></div>
						<h3 class="bigcirclenumber">THE OLD SITE</h3>
						<p>The original site was plagued with usability issues. Some were minor, easy fixes, otheres were most definately not. As I summerized in my final handover, the most glaring issues of the site were:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>A Facebook login was required to view the site.</strong> I wish I had some statistics to show exactly how many people this awful design choice turned away from the site.</li>
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure><img src="images/fblogin.PNG" alt="A picture that shows the first screen the user sees: log in with Facebook to see our content." style="width: 95%" class="img-reponsive myshadow pop"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.1</strong> The worst of all Facebook-gates: log in or our content won't show.</figcaption></figure></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Designed for desktop use ONLY.</strong> The website was not scalable at all, and viewing it on smaller devices was a pain. It forced the user to explore the site in both dimensions with a fixed-width design, none of the media content scaled to size and the navigation bar stayed a horizontal, fixed-width chore, no matter the viewport size.</li>
						
							<li><strong>Awful use of screen real estate.</strong> In spite of being desktop-only, the website content was all crammed into 740 pixels at the center of the viewport.</li> 
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="images/wasted.PNG" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.2</strong> Not scalable, fixed-width and with serious waste of screen real-estate. Big sins. </figcaption></figure></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>The website had two main groups of users, but all links to the website took you to the main landing page.</strong> The users of the site were predominantly fans of local bands, there to vote for their idols, or local bands, there to post their name for the contest. Regardless, links shared through social media would push you through the Facebook-gate, which would redirect you to the main landing page instead of a specific band page or a submission form.</li> 
						</ul>
						
						<div class="numberCircle"><span>2</span></div>
						<h3>THE NEW SITE</h3>
						<p>I was asked if what they already had could be used as a scaffolding for what they had in mind. After consulting with an actual web developer, I decided to say no to this question. Repurposing the work already there would take a greater effort than a fresh start. So I took some time to think about the gamification-aspects of the site. It had to get users to return to the site. In its old state, there was no reason to visit the site after you  had cast your vote. I eventually landed on an idea that took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. Here is what I went with:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Visitors should quickly be able to see the current, active competetition.</strong> Since most users of the site are fans there to vote for their favorite local band to perform the opening act for a headlining band, this feature should be front-and-center. </li>
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="images/mainpage.png" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.3</strong> The main landing page. The large panels all represent a headlining band. When the user hovers over each picture, details about competing bands are revealed. </figcaption></figure></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>The site should be a forum.</strong> The best incentive, I thought, had to be a sense of community. I still believe this, and the idea matches music quite well, logically. Music brings people together, after all. The forum structure divides the country into regions or cities with venues. These subforums are then divided by local bands, each acting as a new subforum for fan activity and discussion. Naturally, the band-subforums are not split between venues and cities. </li>
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="https://s1.gifgif.io/TEZu6Z.gif" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.4</strong> A gif showing the inteded structure of the forum by navigating a expandable/collapsible design. An animation to go with the interaction would make it even clearer to the user what happens. </figcaption></figure></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Users are rewarded with points and badges based on activity.</strong> I call these hero points and badges. Hero points are obtained through most actions on the website, and are easy to come by. Badges mark one-time achivements and are a little harder to obtain. The most active users get the chance to become band ambassadors, based on the sub-community vote.</li>
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="images/Bbadges.PNG" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.5</strong> A page to keep track of badges and achievements. </figcaption></figure></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Users compete in regions through activity.</strong> The most active users and regions are highlighted on a map. This is intended to encourage competitive spirit and reward dedication.</li>
						</ul>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="https://www.gifgif.io/90uzDg.gif" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.6</strong> A gif showing an imaginary user browsing by region, selecting the region with the most points and then clicking on the portrait of the person ranked #1 on the leaderboard. </figcaption></figure></div>
							<div class="pop indent"><figure style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="images/Bprofile.png" class="img-reponsive myshadow" style="width: 95%"><figcaption style="text-align: center"><strong>Fig.7</strong> The user profile page where stats, badges and hero points are all tracked. The idea is that building your reputation and forum presense is incentive for users to use the site frequently.</figcaption></figure></div>

						<h3>EVALUATION & REFLECTION</h3>
						<p>This project is old. I worked on it before having really found my calling in UX, and my inexperience shows. So let me quickly go over some things that should have been handled differently:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Do the research.</strong> Are the people you are trying to reach going to visit on their phones, tablets, laptop or desktop? Are they going to be on the go or sitting at a desk? What kind of agegroup are we looking at? These are just some of the questions that should be answered before even writing one line of code.</li>
							<li><strong>Design for mobile first.</strong> It isn't too far fetched (in my opinion) to say that since the sites main flow of visits stems from social media redirects, some users will be on their phones or tablets. Designing for mobile first also ensures that the very essence of the experience will be the focal point of the project.</li>
							<li><strong>Don't let the gamification outshine the purpose.</strong> This was more of a personal objective of mine. I borrowed heavy inspiration from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>'s approach with badges and points, but going though and explaining this idea makes me realize that it seems I got a little carried away.</li>
							<li><strong>Test. Often.</strong>It goes without saying that if I had to re-do this project, I would incoperate many quick and dirty usability tests throughout an iterative design process. The project, in its current state, is not validated at all, since it has never been in the hands of a user.</li>
							<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Hand-in-hand with the point about testing just above, some of the features described should have been omitted until later iterations, so that the core idea could properly be worked on, first.</li>
							<li><strong>The site REALLY needs breadcrumbs.</strong> To avoid a "lost-at-sea" feel, or, in other words, to give the user a sense of location, the site should have breadcrumbs that highlight the path they took to get where they are. This also makes it easier for the person to see how to get back.</li>
							<li><strong>Consistency.</strong> Though the project does have a good deal of consistency, it could be better. Some pages omit the search bar entirely. If search is going to be a central part of the site, it needs to be easily accessible from every part of the site.</li>
						</ul>
