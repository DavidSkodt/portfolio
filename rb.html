						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<div class="p-indented">
							<p><strong>Employed at </strong> BotSupply</p>
							<p><strong>Client </strong> Red Barnet</p>
							<p><strong>Timeframe </strong> 4 months</p>
							<p><strong>My role </strong> Design lead</p>
							<p><strong>My contribution </strong> Project design and scope, research, stakeholder management, developer handoff</p>
						</div>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>Today, we live in a world where anything digital is easy to share. All it takes is a few taps and you can share whatever you like. For today’s teens, sharing a private photo with someone else is a common part of exploring ones own sexuality in this digital age. </p>
						<p>But the ease and speed at which pictures and video can be shared has lead to a new, terrifying trend: revenge porn. In the worst of cases, images and video intended only for a single person spreads on social media at an unstoppable rate. Once material is viral, it exists forever. Being the victim of such a crime leaves a mark, and the victims, in many cases, are children.</p>
						<p>Our client, Red Barnet (Save the Children) runs an initiative called SletDet (DeleteIt). They provide help to victims of revenge porn and other online sexual harassment issues through an anonymous phone service and an online forum. </p>
						<h2>Problem</h2>
						<p>The SletDet staff consists of a small number of trained, expert social workers with many other responsibilities. This meant that they were only able to man the phones and answer on forums in a narrow window of time each week. A victim’s need for help, however, was often very immidiate.</p>
						<h2>Process</h2>
						<div class="col-md-12" style="";>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="./images/rbcase/rbprocess.png" alt="Current stage of development">
						</div>
						<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the project, alot of effort went into the research phase of the projects</p>
						<h3>Research</h3>
						<p>In order to understand where we best could leverage chatbot technology for our client, we had to make sure we understood what the victims were going through.</p>
						<p>We pooled findings from ethnographic research, stakeholder interviews, desk research and a workshop in order to find patterns in what we were seeing.</p>

						<h3>The most important take-aways</h3>
						<p>Though a large part of the support that SletDets experts give out on a daily basis is practical, we quickly learned that emotional support was more important to the long-term mental health of victims.</p>
						
						<p>We learned that the largest barriers for reaching out for help was shame and the fear of being judged, and that talking to anyone about it was very difficult.</p>
						<p>We also found out that communicating with a bot about the issue didn't evoke the same fears.</p>

						
						<h2>Solution</h2>
						<p>We built a chat bot solution that could help children who were victims of online sexual harassment outside of operating hours. Inside of opening hours, the bot is also able to answer the most common practical questions that are are asked, giving the advisors space to focus on questions and cases that do not have a simple answer. </p>
						<h3>Getting past the shame</h3>
						<p>Though they wish they could, the empathetic experts at SletDet can only do so much for a victim with the limited resources at their disposal. We realized that if the ultimate goal of SletDet is to support victims of online sexual harassment, then the best we can do is giving the victim a actionable plan and gently guiding them to open up about what has happened to a parent.</p>
						<p>Calling, to some, was way too personal and getting help through an online form left victims frustrated at not knowing what to do in the meantime. The shame and fear of being judged also played a large role in what could prevent victims from seeking out help. </p>
						<p>Because victims can recieve advice specific to their situation from a machine through dialog, the stakes feel much lower. Through our stakeholder interviews with experts, we learned that opening up and mentally going through the situation is a crucial first step, so we wanted for the chatbot to act as a primer for doing that. </p>
						<h3>Conversational design</h3>
						<p>Showing a ‘typical’ conversation won’t tell you much, because the syntax is identical to how two people might chat. With that said, we did design the bot’s approach to conversation to, roughly, follow this approach:</p>
						<div class="p-indented">
							<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Understand - The bot listens- and attempts to understand the situation.</p>
							<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Damage control - If the situation requires immidiate action, the bot guides the child to what they should do first and foremost.</p>
							<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Advice - The bot goes into giving advice about how to tackle the situation, and offers an actionable, step-by-step approach for the child.</p>
							<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Speak to an adult - The bot prompts the child to speak to an adult they know and trust - and offers to put the child in contact with a Red Barnet advisor. </p>
						</div>
						<p>Here's a very rough idea of how the bot operates if the user decides to write. It is also possible to click (or tap) through the options that the bot presents, with contextually relevant quickreplies. These quickreplies also hint at what sort of answer the bot might be expecting.</p>
						<div class="col-md-12" style="";>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="./images/rbcase/rbhighlevel.png" alt="Current stage of development">
						</div>
						<h3>Nudging</h3>
						<p>It is possible to write anything to the bot, but AI is still only as good as we program it to be. It might understand any situation we tell it to, regardless of how it is formulated, but we can’t account for every concievable scenario. This is why a big part of the design of the bot was to ensure that the bot always offered a suggestion of what to talk about, depending on the context of the conversation.</p>
						<h3>"Are you a real person?"</h3>
						<p>In general, it's important not to decieve your users. That's why we let the bot introduce itself as a bot immidiately. By doing this, we also adjust the users’ mental model. They do not expect the 1:1 minute situational understanding of a conversation they might have with a person.</p>
						<p>Through natural language processing and AI, out bot was able to understand- and give general advice about a wide range of difficult situations. Through nudging techniques and careful writing, the bot also prompts the child to reach out to an adult they trust - or be put in contact with one of Red Barnets human advisors. </p>
						
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>So, is our solution making the right kind of impact? It’s too soon to tell.</p>
						<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the problem, the state that a victim might be in and the anonymity promised, it is difficult to test if the bot succesfully leads anyone to reach out that otherwise wouldn’t. </p>
						<p>A good way to test the solution is to see how many children agree to be put in contact with an advisor, and compare that number to how many would reach out before. Because the bot does not replace any of the prior modes of contact, it is important to consider the solution valid if the amount of referrals exceeds the total across all means of contact. </p>
						<p>Thanks to our awesome development team, we can easily track which dialog options are visited, and which questions are being asked. This means that we know when the bot is unable to understand what a child is asking. This means that once the solution is live, we are able to add to the bots knowledge, if we see important aspects missing.</p>
						<h2>That's it</h2>
						<p>Phew! You read all of that? Thank you so much! If you have feedback, comments, or for other reasons would like to reach out to me, I would be more than happy to chat.</p>
