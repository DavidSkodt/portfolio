						<p>I am a huge movie geek, and I always felt like there was something romantic about going to the cinema. That sense of romanticism, however, has been tarnished a bit over the years, as I have grown frustrated with a few of the things I now have come to associate with the movie-going experience: the exceedingly high cost of candy, and a clunky, sub-optimal website experience.</p>
						
						<p>In this project, I attempt to use research and intuition to identify real usability issues and pain points on a live, cinema website. This was my very first real design project, so a lot of the techniques and software that I used, I had to teach myself along the way. At the very end of this case study, I reflect upon the most important lessons this project has taught me.
					
					
						<p>This case study can be seen as two parts of a whole. In this first part, I evaluate the current website and gather knowledge through research. In the second, I try to tackle the task of redesigning the website.</p>
						<p>If you just want to skip straight to the redesign, <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/gTPmj7qiKUUko2orqFnudjTR/NFBio?scaling=contain&node-id=42%3A192" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">click here to try the prototype.</a></p>

						<h1 class="sectionheader">Research</h1>
						<p>Since I had no direct access to any of the company’s data, I had to get creative.</p>
						
						<h3>Preliminary research</h3>
						
						<p>Nordisk Film Biografer is the largest chain of cinemas in Denmark, and owns 22 different cinemas, spread out across the country. The cinemas receive about 6 million visitors annually, in total. Their website gets about 513.000 views per month. Kino.dk, which is a ticket hub for 49 Danish cinemas, including the cinemas from NFbio.dk, gets about twice as many views. Kino.dk also offers ticket sales to Nordisk Film Biografers showings, but I have no way of knowing which of the two sites sell more tickets on Nordisk Film Biografers behalf.</p>
						
						<p>The information I managed to scrape together was scarce and dated. The graph below is from a cultural survey from 2012. It tells me that teens and young adults are the primary movie-goers. I used this knowledge to focus on the younger of two personas.
						

						<img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 80%" src="./images/cinemabyage.png" alt="A graph that shows that young adults go to the cinema more than other age groups">

						
						<p>I wrote an email to Nordisk Film Biografer, thinking they might be willing to offer me some ethnographic data, and hoping that they could tell me how many of their customers bought or reserved their tickets online. This was not information that they were willing to disclose, unfortunately. </p>

						<h3>The Guerilla Test</h3>
						
						<p>In order to learn more about how people interacted with the website, I wanted to conduct a usability test. Due to a lack of resources (both in time, manpower and funds), I decided to conduct a <strong>guerrilla test</strong>. This is an alternative to doing a full usability test, which comes with its own pros and cons. The key difference lies in how people are recruited for the test. In a traditional usability study, people are recruited in advance, for long (45 minutes - 1 hour) sessions. This allows for depth and rigor. The guerrilla version takes place in public, where people are recruited for short, on-the-spot sessions.</p>

						<p>The most important of these points is arguably that you rarely get to test with people who are within resemble your users, but a guerrilla test is rarely the only test that you would do on a larger project. I argue that it serves the role of being a preliminary test, meant to catch broad issues. In my case, however, it stands on its own because of resource constraints.</p>
						<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
							<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The test included just the mobile version of the current (as of date of test) website. The test focused mostly on navigation, as required by the different tasks.</p>
							<p><strong>Scope:</strong> The purpose of the test was to locate as many possible pain points as possible that may create friction in the flows related to the most common user goals. Secondarily, observing people interact with the current design would give me valuable insights into the user.</p>
							<p><strong>Length:</strong> 15 minutes, max. Because I approached people during shopping, I knew that even 15 minutes would be stretching it.</p>
							<p><strong>Participants:</strong> Anyone with a smartphone, who reported having been to the cinema within the last two months.</p>
							<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> Due to the relative small scale of the project and small group of participants, the things I payed attention to were mostly qualitative. I payed particular attention to user pain points, critical errors and task completion rates.</p>
						</div>
						<p>In preparation of the test, I wanted to figure out what users wanted to accomplish when visiting the website. I made a survey on social media, asking what people usually went to cinema sites to do.</p>
						
						<p>The three goals that were mentioned the most were:</p>
						<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
							<p><strong>1:</strong> To see what movies are showing this week.</p>
							<p><strong>2:</strong> To see the show times on a particular date.</p>
							<p><strong>3:</strong> To see which movies are coming out in the near future.</p>
							<p><strong>4:</strong> To order a ticket, knowing already what they want to see and where.</p>
						</div>
						<p>I used these three goals as the core focus for my usability test and to limit the scope of my redesign. In order to run a test with these goals, I had to rewrite them into tasks, and then build up scenarios around the task. Note that these scenarios were written and executed in Danish, but that the translated versions below match the phrasing and tone fairly well. I was careful to phrase the scenarios in such a way that the words did not match any navigation elements on the cinema website.</p>
						
						<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
							<p><strong>Exploratory task:</strong> This is the website. First, I would like you to look around and tell me your impressions. What do you think is possible on this site? You can scroll up and down, but please stay on this page to begin with.</p>
							<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You want to go to the movies, but haven’t decided on which movie to watch. You plan to go to the cinema this Sunday night. The closest cinema to you is in the Field’s shopping mall, in Copenhagen.</br>
							Find out which movies are showing on Sunday (the 10th).</p>
							<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong>You and your two friends are talking about watching the movie “Baby Driver”. You agree to go to the cinema on Wednesday the 13. Of September, at around 20:00. You decide to go to the cinema located in Kennedy Arkaden, Aalborg. </br>
							Reserve three (3) tickets for the movie “Baby Driver” on the 13. Of September at around 20:00 at the cinema in Kennedy Arkaden, Aalborg.</p>
							<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> There aren’t really any movies currently showing that you want to see. You figure you’ll look ahead a little, to see what is coming out later.</br>
							Find out which movies are coming out in October.</p>
						</div>
						<p>In order to record the sessions, I constructed a DIY “Brundlefly”, as coined by Steve Krug, from a universal phone holder, a webcam and duct tape. <a href="http://community.uxmastery.com/t/i-made-a-cheap-rig-for-recording-phone-usability-tests-in-less-than-30-minutes/4858" target="_blank">Want to see how I made it?</a></p>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="./images/brundlefly.jpg" alt="A picture of a homemade device for capturing video of people when they use a smartphone.">
						<p>My initial plan was to conduct the test on moviegoers at the local cinema, but my idea was quickly shot down when I was politely rejected when I proposed the idea to them over the phone. The thought had crossed my mind that they might, but I wasn’t quite prepared for how many places would shut me out when I then called around to the places I had considered as backup locations. Most people were afraid that I would upset their customers, or asked me to pay a fee. I eventually had some luck at the very local grocery store. A grocery store is a sub-optimal choice, because people don't "hang around" at grocery stores. They are there to complete a specific task, and then leave.</p>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="./images/brugsensetup.jpg" alt="A picture of my setup at the local grocery store.">
						<p>I approached shoppers politely, and asked for their time in return for covering a small amount of their bill on groceries (25 DKK ≈ 4.11 USD). I wrangled 4 participants into participating. I had hoped for at least 5, but the store grew very quiet at 7 pm.</p>

						<p>Even with so few tasks and participants, this served as a good indicator of where to put most of my focus. Using this table as an outset, I arranged the issues that I observed on a priority list, going from high to low priority. Priority is based on how serious the issue is for the user experience, and for the bottom line of the Nordisk Film Biografer.</p>
						
						<img class="img-responsive" style="width: auto; max-height: 90vh;" src="./images/ranked.jpg" alt="A picture of the most prominent issues, on post-its">

						<h3>1: Ticket buying progress resets after logging in</h3>
						<p>After specifying movie, date, time and cinema, if the participant was not logged in beforehand, all progress would be lost.</br>
						<p>This was the case for all participants. I later checked on several devices and browsers, and the issue persisted.
						This issue was the most severe because it sets back to square one and doesn’t tell them why. I will strongly argue that this issue has a direct impact on the amount of people who complete the ticketing process.</p>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 800px;" src="./images/crashflow.png" alt="A picture of the most prominent issues, on post-its">
						<p>Edit: This issue has since been fixed.</p>
						
						<h3>2: Upcoming movies are hard to locate</h3>
						<p>The navigation item that takes users to the “upcoming movies”-page difficult to find. One participant searched for 6 minutes and another for 3½ minutes before I stopped them, as I sensed their frustration.</p>
						<p><em>"I just can't find it"</em>, several of the participants voiced.</p>
						<p>Having forgotten where the menu item was since originally creating the tasks, I also failed to locate the item, when asked by a participant.</p>
						<p>The page is reached by clicking a very ambiguous item in a drop down menu labeled “select movie”. This drop down is the third consecutive drop down in a column, after “choose cinema” and “choose date”.</p>
						
						<img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 90vh; width: auto;" src="./images/Issue_UpcomingMovies.png" alt="A picture of the most prominent issues, on post-its">
						
						<p>Seeing as the act of checking future releases turned out to be in the top 3 of reported goals in the preliminary research, this needs to be much easier to locate. </p>
						<p>A fast and cheap solution to this would be to relocate the menu item, perhaps as one of the tabs at the top of the site.</p>
						
						<img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="./images/upcomingmockup.png" alt="A mockup of a possible solution to the issue of the page named upcoming movies being overlooked.">
						
						<p>If resources are not an issue, the best placement could be determined with an open card sort. This would also likely lead to more intuitive information architecture, overall.</p>
						
						
						<h3>3: The “buy / reserve” dialogue box is ambiguous.</h3>
						<p>After selecting a movie, you are prompted then to select a show time. When clicking a time, a dialogue box appears. This box, with it’s “buy / reserve” button was frequently a point where participants would hesitate.</p>
						<p>Participants would scroll up or down, as if they had missed something. In other words, they are uncertain if this is the step they should be taking next. That might be because there is a lot going on, and the design does very little to lead them.</p>
						<p>If they just selected the movie, a dialogue appears and the background darkens. Good, they know that they have to focus on what is in the foreground. But this dialogue is very convoluted, and the show times are not visible until you scroll down. There are 5 different red square buttons screaming for attention, none of which are actually the button that takes them to the next step in the process. If they scroll down, they see the movie show times for every cinema that shows this movie (unless they specified the cinema) which can be as many as all of them (23).</p>
						<img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 150vh; width: auto;" src="./images/longoversight.png" alt="A mockup of a possible solution to the issue of the page named upcoming movies being overlooked.">
						<p>Clicking one of these times makes another dialogue appear, with another small red square button that says “reserve/buy”. The dialogue is about 1/9th the size of the screen, and the same background color and hue as the background behind it. </p>
						<p>A fast and cheap solve for this is to make the second dialogue much larger and more prominent, so that it takes up more space and appears more important as well as making the button to progress visually distinguished from the rest.</p>

						<p>The better solution would be to restructure the first dialogue box, so that the show times are immediately visible, and generally strive for better visual cues.</p>

						<h3>4: The “cinemas” tab confused some participants</h3>
						<p>I observed a few instances where the participants would choose to press the “cinemas” tab, instead of using the drop-down menus on the “tickets” tab. </p>
						<p>People would then stay here for a little while, scrolling up and down, not quite sure how to progress.</p>
						<p>This tab has a lot of things fighting for attention. Six menu items, some of which are redundant, three unlinked movie posters, and a carousel that advertises the upcoming events for this particular cinema are the first things to catch the eye. “Program” is among the menu items, and there is also a separate “see program” button visible under the headline: “Program”, immediately following the menu.  </p>
						<p>So if they are so plainly visible, why do people not see them?</p>
						<p>What the participant expected was to see the program for the cinema, front and center. They scan the page, hoping to see images of movie posters that they can click on, or another dropdown menu for movie selection.</p>
						<p>The quick fix here is to simply put the program as the main item of the submenu.</p>

						<p>The better solution would be to distinguish the buttons with clearer signifiers, so that users immediately identify their options on this page.</p>
						
						<h3>5: Pressing “next week” when browsing by date only moves the view three days at the time</h3>
						<p>This is quite a small issue, and likely stems from the fact that the website hasn’t been developed mobile-first.</p>
						<p>When browsing by date, the button says “next week”, but only moves as many days ahead as can fit on whichever device is being used.</p>
						<p><em>“Isn’t Sunday part of this week?”</em>, one participant asked, hesitating to press the “next week” button when the view was only letting her see as far as Saturday.<em>"It is a little confusing that it only shows 3 days at the time"</em>, they elaborated.</p>
						<p>The simple fix is to change this to just say “next”, which they have done since I conducted the test.</p>
						
						<h3>6: “Events” is unclear.</h3>
						<p>While I initially categorized this problem as “medium priority”, based on the fact that one of the main navigational tabs could be misinterpreted, I later choose to re-categorized this issue to “low priority”. The reason it is now less important is because the confusion was only mentioned once, and by only one participant. The confusion presumably stems from the word being a foreign language from Danish, but the way she phrased this was ambiguous. She could has well have understood the word, but never have heard of a cinema holding events before. </p>
						
						<h3>7: The “buy/reserve” dialogue glitches</h3>
						<p>When you click a show time twice, the “buy/reserve” dialogue will disappear, and pressing the desired time again will not make it reappear. For it to reappear, you have to click another time first, and then the intended one, or reload the page.</p>
						<p>This happened only once during the test, which is why I deemed it low priority. </p>
						
						<h3>In conclusion...</h3>
						<p>Based on working with the website, I feel like a lot of their issues boil down to three things.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Confusing page structure</li>
							<li>Indistinguishable buttons</li>
							<li>Poor navigation elements</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I have provided possible solutions based on the problems that the usability test revealed. This guerrilla test would be an excellent precursor to more extensive testing of the current website, but that isn't within the scope of my project. Instead, armed with new-found knowledge, I decided to try my hands at redesigning the website.</p>

						<h1 class="sectionheader">The Redesign</h1>
						<p>Now, there are plenty of arguments as to why a redesign of the website isn’t entirely necessary. Resource-wise, I have given fairly easy solutions to all of the usability issues that I found. I wanted to do a redesign in order to teach myself how. That is, after all, what this entire project is about.</p>
						
						<p>The best way to do design anything, is to test with your users throughout an iterative process. At each iteration of the project, I consulted with more experienced designers through different online communities. I went through 3 iterations before landing on a final design.</p>

						<p>The redesign is a web-app, built using Figma (though I used Axure for the two iterations of wireframes). The resolution is 411x731 dp, which is the resolution of a Nexus 6 or Google Pixel. I chose to design a web-app, based on the assumption that Nordisk Film Biografer would like a one-fits-all solution. By choosing a web-app over a native app, you can make your solution scalable and independent on OS. The cost of maintenance is also drastically reduced.</p>
						
						<p>In order to limit the breadth of the project a little, <strong>I decided to focus on the user flow for ticket reservation / purchase</strong>. I put my focus there, because it is likely to be the most important flow for the business objective of the company. <strong>Secondarily, I wanted to flesh out the features necessary for users to achieve the 3 most common goals revealed by the preliminary research.</strong></p>

						<h3>Design decisions</h3>
						<p>I decided to stick with their existing color scheme. The dark design fits well with a cinema experience, and the red (though a tricky color in designing for the western world) reminds me of the color of show curtains. </p>
						<p>I wanted there to be less visual clutter on the website, and for it to be obvious to the user what interactions were possible. For that reason, I used red as the primary color for CTAs.</p>
						<p>On the original website, the "next step" when ordering tickets was hard to find. You had to scroll down (and back up, as observed in most cases, during scenario 2 of the test) to find the right button. For that reason, I decided to make the screens in the ticket flow fixed in size, and place the "next" button near the bottom of the screen fairly consistently. The exception to this is when the user has to choose between "reserve" and "buy", because I wanted there to be visual distinction, to hint to the user that there was a choice to be considered.</p>
						<p>The decision to make "choose cinema" a modal of its own, and not simply a dropdown, was a difficult one. My first arguement for the modal over a dropdown is certainty. The dropdown would have had to contain 21 cinemas, browsable by name, city or both. There would not be space for more than that. I forsee use-cases in which users do not know the name of the cinema closest to them, which is where the location pin and adresse comes in handy. By clicking the pin next to a cinema adresse they were unsure of, an embedded Google Maps widget shows them the location of the cinema. Click that, and it takes them to Google Maps, for further investigation. The second arguement for the modal is because I wanted to give the option to pick your favorite cinema, so that on next visit, it is already selected for you. Is that a good idea? Not sure! It is based on two assumptions that should be tested on next iteration:</p>

						<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
							<p><strong>1:</strong> Most visitors to the site already know in which geographical area they want to go to the cinema</p>
							<p><strong>2:</strong> In most instances, on a return visit to the site, people go to the same cinema that they did the first time</p>
						</div>

						<p>On the "choose seats" screen, instead of first selecting how many seats you want and then clicking, I wanted it to be possible to simply click (or click and drag) how many seats you want. The amount of seats and the cost is then displayed on the "next" button.</p>
						<p>I wanted to make it obvious how long the process was. That can be difficult to display, because there are many different use cases. I added a progress bar at the top of the screen, once users had gone past the initial selection of place, day and time.</p>

						<h3>Prototype</h3>
						<p>As a part of the project, I put together a working prototype. The intention was to use it to test the ticket flow on the next iteration of the project.</p>

						<h1 class="sectionheader">What this project has taught me</h1>
						<p>"Wait, that's it?" I hear you saying. I wanted to test my design by the same parameters as their existing website, but just as I was getting ready for the next iteration, I got invited to do some work with a local start-up.</p>
						<p>This entire project was my introduction to a lot of new software and methods. The case study format felt a little familiar, reminding me of my time spent on academic writing. Being able to decide on the format was refreshing, going away from writing to academics to writing to people. That leads me into the first take-away:
						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p>UX is, in essense, about communication. Software and websites need to be able to communicate purpose, possible actions, restrictions and limitations to the target user (and then some). Conducting a good usability test is about communicating intentions, procedure and process, yet in language that eases the participant and makes it feel natural and fluid. Even writing this case study is about communication, as I tell you about my approach, my process, my hurdles and my findings. Even this very paragraph is about communicating what I have learned about communication. Woah.</p>
						<p>I want to become a better writer, and continue to improve my skills in visual communication.</p>
						<h3>Planning</h3>
						<p>I had planned for the project to take two months, including writing this case study and making this website. Haha! Yea, I was a little off. The entire thing took 5 months in total, which made me feel ashamed, at first. But instead, let's turn that into a valuable lesson about planning, shall we?</p>
						<p>I think I could have been more realistic in planning the project if I had spent more time planning each stage, instead of just defining them and then diving head-first into it. Part of the reason it took so long was because I had to learn every step along the way, from testing to coding HTML & CSS. Having now gone through every stage, I feel like I have a much better understanding of what goes into developing a product or service, from research to development.</p>
						<p>If this project has taught me two lesson, it's <strong>to take smaller bites.</strong> and <strong>be less thorough.</strong> If I had moved faster with less regard for my own assumptions of "correctness" when it came to designing the structure of the redesign, I would have been able to iterate more effectively and thus, improve the design.</p>
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<p>I found that I really enjoyed working with Figma. The intuitive UI, the ability to seamlessly collaborate on the same project and the fact that it can be used in a browser, making it independent of OS are just some of the things that will make me interested in working in Figma again.</p>
						<p>Though Figma is amazing tool that makes it simple to share prototypes, the animations that they allow are fairly rudamentary. I wasn't able to make the main tab views scrollable, and I wish that it was possible to animate interactions that weren't transitions.</p>
